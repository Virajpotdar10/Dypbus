# Bus Fleet Management System - System Purpose and Workflow

This system was built for the D.Y. Patil Transport Facility to solve the challenges of managing student transportation. It replaces inefficient manual processes with a modern, real-time, and role-based digital platform.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to provide a centralized and synchronized system for administrators and bus drivers to manage student data, routes, and fee payments efficiently and securely.

## Workflow

The system operates based on two main user roles:

1.  **Admin (Head of Transport):** Has global access to a comprehensive dashboard. Admins can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all drivers, routes, and students. They oversee the entire transportation system.

2.  **Driver:** Has restricted access to a mobile-friendly dashboard. Drivers can only view and manage their assigned routes and the students on those routes. They can update student information and fee status in real-time.

All data changes are instantly synchronized across all connected users (Admins and Drivers) using Socket.IO, ensuring everyone has the most up-to-date information.
